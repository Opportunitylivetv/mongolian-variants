_Updating the shape index_


When changes have been made to index.html:

1. uncomment the textarea and script at the bottom of index.html and open/refresh the page

2. copy the text in the textarea into link-data.js

3. if this is a new shape, add a line to shape-array.js with an id and a list of primitives



If you want to change the primitives associated with a shape, edit the appropriate line in shape-array.js.
